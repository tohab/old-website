<p>Yup this is <br> (oh a break!) pretty cool :)..  <a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org">This is a link</a> </p>


<p style="color:red">  Paragraphs can also have colors! <b> And be bolded! </b> </p>

<p title="See, it's a cool thing!"> Paragraphs can also have title attributes. They take a little bit of hovering over to show up.</p>

<h3 style="border:2px solid Tomato;text-align:center;background-color:pink"> Here's a poem </h3>
<p style="color:blue;text-align:center;"> O danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling,
<br>
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
<br>
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
<br>
'Tis you, 'tis you, must go and I must bide.
</p>

<!-- The <pre> tag makes text be displayed exactly as you typed it. -->

<h3 style="border:2px solid Tomato;text-align:center;background-color:pink"> Here's another poem coded differently </h3>
<pre> 
My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
My Bonnie lies over the sea.
My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

<h4 style="text-align:center;color:green"> A demo of formatting </h4>

<b> You can make text bold </b> <br>
<i> Or italicised </i>
<em> Or emphasised, </em> <strong> or strong </strong>. These have the same meaning as bold and italicised, but different for search engines etc. <br>
<mark> if your name is mark you can use this tag </mark>
<del> and if you wanna take something back just use this </del>, and then <ins> add it back again </ins>. But if you don't wanna make a big deal about it, make it <sub> subscript </sub> or <sup> super-script </sup>

<p>
So sometimes you wanna do a quote. A small quote is easy, like this one from Cesar Chavez: <q> We need, in a special way, to work twice as hard to make all people understand that animals are fellow creatures, that we must protect them and love them as we love ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
Of course, a large quote is easy too cause HTML is easy!
<blockquote>
There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious—makes you so sick at heart—that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop.!
</blockquote>
There's also such a thing as an abbreviation. For instance, <abbr title="Berkeley Organization for Animal Advocacy">BOAA</abbr> was founded twenty years ago.
